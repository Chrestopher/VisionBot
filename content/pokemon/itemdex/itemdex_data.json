It can only be used when the player is on foot and within Tall Grass.\nWhen the PokéRadar is being used, various grass tiles will shake. The more vigorous the shake of the grass, the rarer the Pokémon.\nA feature of the PokéRadar is chaining. When you defeat or capture a Pokémon you have discovered with the PokéRadar, the chain begins and you need to follow the chain to other grass tiles to continue the chain. These chains are broken when a different Pokémon appears or you encounter a Wild Pokémon outside of the set grass tiles so it is recommended that you use Repel or other Wild Pokémon prevention techniques.\nShiny Pokémon are easily findable with the PokéRadar. If you have found a Shiny Pokémon with the PokéRadar, the grass will shine as opposed to shaking. With chaining, you have the ability to increase the likelihood of finding a Shiny Pokémon. This is done by having a prolonged chain on the PokéRadar. The chances increase up until the 40th Pokémon in the chain. This is calculated with the following formula;\nChance = (14747 - 40*ChainNumber)/2621440(41-ChainNumber)\nAfter each use of the PokéRadar, it requires recharging. This is done by walking 50 steps.",
